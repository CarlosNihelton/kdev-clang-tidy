# kdev-clang-tidy

A plugin for [KDevelop](https://www.kdevelop.org) to support [clang-tidy](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) 
static analysis.
It uses the [KDevelop5 Problem Checker Framework](https://techbase.kde.org/KDevelop5/Problem_Checker_Framework), parsing 
clang-tidy's output and showing the issues on the Problems Viewer, allowing easy review of the code.

## Build and install
In order to build this plugin you must have the libraries for KDevPlatform and KDevelop installed into your system.
Get the source code from this repository(https://github.com/CarlosNihelton/kdev-clang-tidy), tweak it if you want, run 
cmake to configure the project, build it and have fun.

## TO-DO List
- Add unit tests.
- Refine the code:
 - Exclude unnecessary includes from all sources;
 - Review the encapsulation to extend/shrink number of members inside the classes;
- Implement the interactive fix feature:
 - Add output to yaml option into command line;
 - Parse yaml output to display on a suggested correction widget;
 - Create a widget to allow user to choose which correction to use and which ignore;
 - Create a way to exclude some corrections per user wish from the original yaml output;
 - Use clang-apply-replacements to apply the remained fixes from the yaml file.
